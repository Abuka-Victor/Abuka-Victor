 Yeah, all the greats. I enjoy my work because it lets me impact my society in a way that solves real problems for people. Thus, I am engineering a more comfortable existence for humanity. You can call me a magician. When I'm not coding I do love to listen to music, play games and watch anime. My favorite saying is from a chinese proverb - **Cut your own wood and it will warm you twice**. Feel free to reach out to me via my social handles. Here is a rare gif of me coding
